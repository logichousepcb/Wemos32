This is a board I created to connect a Wemos D1 Mini or ESP32 to my windows and door sensors of my house to automate events in Home Assistant.

They windows and door binary sensors plug into the front ports on the device RJ45 connectors. Eech RJ45 connector has 4 ports with each twisted pair on the connector connecting to a pin and ground. There are 8 ports for a total of 32 binary sensors.

The I2C bus is also exposed on a header for connections of additional devices such as an OLED on other sI2C based sensors.

There is a USB passthrough that you can connect the ESP to so the USB port is exposed on the front of the board.
